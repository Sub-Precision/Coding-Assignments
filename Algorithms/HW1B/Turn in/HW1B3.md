a) Deterministic brute-force guessing
algorithm:

         Number of Tries: 10000
         The highest number of guesses
         in a try 729
         The lowest number of tries: 1
         The average number of tries:
         365.2492
b) Pure random guessing algorithm

         Number of Tries: 10000
         The highest number of guesses
         in a try 7455
         The lowest number of tries: 1
         The average number of tries:
         733.9782
