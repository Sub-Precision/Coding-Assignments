Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: Nichols_C_HW6.cpp
Functional organization: main() takes input & prints the desired output.

Status: It works completely

Hardware & Platform I used: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900K @ 3.50GHz   3.50 GHz 32GB RAM (Windows 11 OS)

Compile: extract the archive, and then from a shell run "make". This will create an executable "hw6". Then run ./hw6

2.2: It creates a dog object and proceeds to follow the pointer functions being move and speak and the dog object does move and speak accordingly.

3.1: It prints the menu first, upon making a selection it constructs the selected class object and its parent class being mammal.

3.2: Yes, yes the subsequent classes inherent all the functions of the parent function unless specifically coded otherwise

3.3: Dog would get the overwritten function from Mammal as dog is derived from mammal first and foremost.

3.4: You can access the overwritten function by using the "::" operator to simply call it like a normal class function.

3.5: That is just a product of inheritance, you can use the standard " . " operator to call it as you would any other function as it inherits the function directly.

3.6: Yes, the 3rd generation function is still virtual as the virtual aspect of this function cannot be removed once instilled.
